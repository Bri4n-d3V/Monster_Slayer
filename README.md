This project is a simple game that simulates a battle against a monster.
The initial setub (first commit) was made by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller for his VUE course.

I made this project just to practice what I've been learning in VueJS.

To play the game just clone this repository and execute the html file using Live Server extension.
